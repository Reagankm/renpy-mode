#+TITLE: Ren'Py mode

PyTom's old major mode for Ren'Py.

I'm maintaining it because the original upstream developer doesn't use either Emacs or Ren'Py anymore. If you use this and know Elisp better than I do (a very low bar), let me know and this major mode is yours.

** Installation

  * Download/clone this repo to your desired location.
  * In Emacs, use the command `M-x package-install-file` and point it to the renpy.el file location
    * This will install it to your `~/.emacs.d/elpa/` directory (or your custom location if you've manually set a different `package-user-dir` in Emacs)
  * In your .emacs file, add `(require 'renpy)`
